"""
The external API of the WBEM client library is defined by the symbols that
are exported from the ``pywbem`` Python package and its sub-modules via their
``__all__`` variables.

Public symbols that are not listed in the ``__all__`` variables are still
available for compatibility reasons (the ``__all__`` variables and a definition
of the external API were introduced in pywbem v0.8). However, they may change
over time.

Consumers of this package that use other symbols than those from the external
API are at the risk of suffering from incompatible changes in future versions
of this package.

The external API is completely available in the ``pywbem`` namespace. That
is the only namespace that needs to be imported by users of the API. The
sub-modules do not need to be imported. It is recommended to use the symbols
in the ``pywbem`` namespace and not those of the sub-modules.

With a few exceptions for tooling reasons, this documentation describes the
symbols of the ``pywbem`` namespace.

The WBEM client library API consists of the following elements:

* :ref:`Package version` - Provides access to the version of the ``pywbem``
  package.
* :ref:`WBEM operations` - Class :class:`WBEMConnection` is the main class of
  the WBEM client library and its methods issue WBEM operations to a WBEM
  server.
* :ref:`CIM objects` - Python classes for representing CIM objects (instances,
  classes, properties, etc.) that are used by the WBEM operations as input or
  output.
* :ref:`CIM data types` - Python classes for representing values of CIM data
  types.
* :ref:`CIM status codes` - CIM status codes returned by failing WBEM
  operations.
* :ref:`Exceptions` - Exceptions specific to pywbem that may be raised.

.. _`Package version`:

Package version
---------------

The package version can be accessed by programs using the following variable.

Note: For tooling reasons, the variable is shown in the namespace
``pywbem._version``. However, it is also available in the ``pywbem`` namespace
and should be used from there.

.. autodata:: pywbem._version.__version__
