usage: wbemcli [options] server

Provide an interactive shell for issuing operations against a WBEM server.

Positional arguments:
  server                Host name or url of the WBEM server in this format:
                             - [{scheme}://]{host}[:{port}]:
                        -scheme: defines the connection type; "https" for an
                         ssl connection or "http"" for a non-ssl connection.
                         The default if there is no scheme prefix is "https.
                        -host: may be  a short or fully qualified DNS hostname,
                         a literal ipv4 address(dotted) or a literal IPV6
                         address(RFC 3986) with zone identifier extensions
                          (RFC6874) supporting "-" or %25 for the delimiter.
                        -port: if provided defines the WBEM server port
                         to be used. If the port suffix is not provided the
                         default ports are:
                            http  - 5988
                            https - 5989
                        The port suffix superceeds the --port argument

Server related options:
  Specify the WBEM server connection type, port, and namespace

  -n namespace, --namespace namespace
                        Namespace in the WBEM server to work against.
                        Default: root/cimv2
  -t timeout, --timeout timeout
                        Timeout in the WBEM server in seconds for operation to
                        complete.
                        Default: No timeout(None)

Connection security related options:
  Specify user name and password or certificates and keys

  -u user, --user user  Username for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: No username.
  -p password, --password password
                        Password for authenticating with the WBEM server.
                        Default: Will be prompted for, if username was
                        specified.
  -nvc, --no-verify-cert
                        Client will not verify WBEM server returned
                        certificate against certificates in cacerts argument
                        or system defined certs. This bypasses a significant
                        part of ssl authentication of the WBEM server to the
                        client but allows encrypted communication with a
                        server for which the client does not have
                        certificates. It does not bypass credential or client
                        certificate authentication by the WBEM server
  --cacerts cacerts     File or directory containing certificates that will be
                        matched against a certificate received from the WBEMserver. However, if None, pywbem will search for
                        for possible certificates in default system directories.
                        --no-verify-cert must be set to bypass client
                         verification of the WBEM server certificaties.
                         The system directories searched for certificates are:
                        /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/openssl/ca-bundle.trust.crt
                        /etc/ssl/certs
                        /etc/ssl/certificates
  --certfile certfile   Client certificate file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. If this option exists the client attempts
                        to execute mutual authentication.
                        Default: None.
  --keyfile keyfile     Client private key file for authenticating with the
                        WBEM server. Not required if private key is part of the
                        certfile option.
                        Default: None. 

General options:
  -v, --verbose         Print more messages while processing
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
