pywbem - A WBEM Client
**********************

The **pywbem** PyPI package provides a WBEM client, written in pure Python.
It supports Python 2 and Python 3.

This package is based on the idea that a good WBEM client should be easy to use
and not necessarily require a large amount of programming knowledge. It is
suitable for a large range of tasks from simply poking around to writing web
and GUI applications.

This documentation describes the API of the **pywbem** PyPI package.

Its general web site is: http://pywbem.github.io/pywbem/index.html.
